# Interactive Photo Gallery and Coding Challenges

This repository contains an interactive photo gallery along with solutions to two coding challenges implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Interactive Photo Gallery
### Setup Instructions
To view the interactive photo gallery:

1.Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.Open the index.html file in a web browser.

### Features
-The photo gallery displays images with descriptions.
-Hovering over an image reveals its description.
-Clicking on an image opens a modal with a larger view of the image.

## Coding Challenges
### Challenge 1: Contiguous Subarray Sum
#### Problem statement
Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.

#### Solution 
The solution is implemented in JavaScript and follows a linear time complexity approach (O(n)), where n is the length of the array

### Challenge 2: String Transformation
#### Problem Statement:
Given a string, transform it based on certain rules:

1.If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
2.If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
3.If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5, perform both operations in the order specified above.

#### Solution
The solution is implemented in JavaScript and handles all possible cases according to the rules specified.
